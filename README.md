Current navigation systems prioritize speed and convenience over environmental impact. We need a solution that considers environmental factors like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover to recommend routes that are not only fast but also eco-friendly.  To provide users with route recommendations that minimize the carbon footprint associated with travel and transportation, thus contributing to a more sustainable way of navigating the world.

**Objectives**:-

1.To develop a system that optimizes routes by considering both speed and environmental factors, providing users with recommendations for the fastest and greenest routes.
2.To use A* algorithm to calculate environmental scores for different routes based on real-time data such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover.
3.To design an intuitive user interface that allows users to input their starting and destination points, set environmental preferences, and receive route recommendations.
4.Ensure that user data is securely handled, and privacy settings are available for user control.

**Modules Used**:-

Weather data module : This module handles the collection and retrieval of real-time weather data from external APIs.It includes functions for fetching temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover data for a given location.

Graph data module : This module handles the road network data and graph representation. It includes functions for building and updating the road network graph.

User interface module : This module handles user interactions, input, and output.Provides a user-friendly interface for entering starting and ending locations also Displays route recommendations to the user.

Route recommendation module : This module combines weather and graph data to recommend eco-friendly routes.It assigns an environmental score to routes and balances environmental impact with travel time.

**Tools**:-

The “Fast and green route optimization” may require the use of other software
products and APIs for specific functionalities. 
For example:
1.HTML/CSS: These technologies are used for building the web-based user interface.
2.Flask: As a Python web framework, Flask may be utilized for
serving web pages and handling user requests.
3.Python Libraries: Various Python libraries and modules may be
employed for code analysis and formatting.
4.SQL:For storing user credentials
